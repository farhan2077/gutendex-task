## Todos

1. ~~Fetch data from the following public API: https://gutendex.com/books~~

   For API Documentation, visit - https://gutendex.com/

2. ~~Display the list of books in a clean and user-friendly format.~~

3. ~~Each book should display the title, author, cover image, author name, genre, and id.~~

4. Functionalities:

   - Implement a search bar that allows users to filter books by title in real-time.
   - Add a dropdown filter to filter books based on genre/topic.
   - ~~Make a wishlist and store it to localStorage. Wishlisted books should have a love or liked icon. Make the icon clickable to save/remove as a wishlist.~~
   - Implement pagination to paginate the books list. For example, (next page, previous page) or (1, 2, 3...8) pagination.

5. User Interface:

   - Make a homepage that will show the books list, a wishlist page that will show the wishlisted books list, and each book page that will show the book details.
   - ~~Make a navbar.~~
   - ~~Design the layout using HTML and CSS.~~
   - Ensure that the application is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
   - ~~Use Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to style the application. But vanilla CSS will be more preferable.~~

6. Optional Bonus Features (Not Required but Encouraged):
   - Implement smooth animations for showing or hiding books.
   - Use localStorage to save the user’s search and filter preferences so they persist when the page is refreshed.

**Notes:**

1. ~~Don’t use any templates for the UI.~~
2. ~~You can use React JS or vanilla JS for this task, but we recommend using vanilla JS only.~~
