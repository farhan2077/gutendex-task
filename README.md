# Gutendex

## Todos

- [x] Fetch data from the following public API: https://gutendex.com/books
      For API Documentation, visit - https://gutendex.com/
- [x] Display the list of books in a clean and user-friendly format.
- [x] Each book should display the title, author, cover image, author name, genre, and id.

### Functionalities

- [x] Implement a search bar that allows users to filter books by title in real-time.
- [x] Add a dropdown filter to filter books based on genre/topic.
- [x] Make a wishlist and store it to localStorage. Wishlisted books should have a love or liked icon. Make the icon clickable to save/remove as a wishlist.
- [x] Implement pagination to paginate the books list. For example, (next page, previous page) or (1, 2, 3...8) pagination.

### User Interface

- [x] Make a homepage that will show the books list, a wishlist page that will show the wishlisted books list, and each book page that will show the book details.
- [x] Make a navbar.
- [x] Design the layout using HTML and CSS.
- [x] Ensure that the application is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- [x] Use Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to style the application. But vanilla CSS will be more preferable.

### Optional Bonus Features

- [x] Implement smooth animations for showing or hiding books.
- [x] Use localStorage to save the user’s search and filter preferences so they persist when the page is refreshed.

### Notes

- [x] Don’t use any templates for the UI.
- [x] You can use React JS or vanilla JS for this task, but we recommend using vanilla JS only.
